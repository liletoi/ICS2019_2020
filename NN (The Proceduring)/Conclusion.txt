The environment was set up and the data was collected. The data was shuffled, trained, and tested. This resulted in a testing score of 51.5%. This result shows either that there was little correlation between the categories selected and the intended outcome or there were data collection/training issues. 
One big way to improve this project is a better system of data collection and recording. There is a surprisingly small amount of accessible population data for endangered species, making it hard to find a full data set. Also, due to the nature of what is being tested, there are entries with identical inputs and differing outputs, making the data impossible to perfectly train. None the less this experiment was successful, if only because the problems above were found.
