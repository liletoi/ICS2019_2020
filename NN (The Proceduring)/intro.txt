There are many criteria for endangered species categories. Many of these criteria are vague leading to animals with vastly different populations and problems being put into the same categories. Is it possible, with the lack of specifics and just plain guesswork, for a neural network to predict the correct categories?
The article “Time Horizons and Extinction Risk in Endangered Species Categorization Systems” discussed how the regulations for categorizations are vague. This causes decisions to be made on a “case-by-case basis,” which can hurt conservation efforts and bring credibility into question. It is thought that an explicit framework being established would be the best course of action to protect from uncertainty. 
“Research Paper on Basic of Artificial Neural Network” discussed how Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are meant to work similarly to the human nervous system. They are made up of many connected processing elements working to solve the same problem. “ANNs, like people, learn by example.” ANNs are made for “pattern recognition or data classification.” 
This neural network will predict an endangered species’ category when given their estimated population, continent of origin, and class.
The environment was set up and the data was collected. The data was shuffled, then roughly two-thirds of the data was used for training. The rest was then used to test the neural network’s accuracy.
